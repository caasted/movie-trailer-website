# movie-trailer-website

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree. It is intended to demonstrate an understanding of python classes by defining a class structure and then creating class objects to be used in generating a webpage that displays the information contained in the class objects.

## Quickstart

To view the movie trailer website, clone the respository to your local machine and then run `python entertainment_center.py`. This will generate an html document using `fresh_tomatoes.py` and open it in your default browser. For more details regarding the `Movie` object used for formatting entries, please see `media.py`.
